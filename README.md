#Polyphonic Pioneer#
---
Polyphonic Pioneer allows users to upload a MIDI file of their favorite song. The app parses the file and uses Markov Chains to analyze the notes and their durations in parallel. This enables the app to generate a new melody inspired by the original song. The result is a unique, algorithmically generated composition that maintains the essence of the original music while introducing fresh, creative variations.
